  title="Autonomous flight in Ornithopter PUT FILES ON THINGIVERSE! AND LINK TO THEM"
  descript="Ornithopters are machines which fly with through the use of flapping there wings. This research project, conducted at New Jersey's Governors School of Engineering and Technology, explores how to achieve hovering and autonomous flight in Ornithopters. The system we built uses arduino and an accelerometer. The code can be found at <a href = 'https://github.com/Lev-Stambler/Arduino-Ornithopter'>my GitHub.</a> The research paper can be found at "
